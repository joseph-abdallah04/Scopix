3. If prompted with a security warning, click "Open" again to confirm

6. Click "Open" when prompted about the unidentified developer
7. Scopix will now launch and can be opened normally in the future

**Note**: This process is required because the app isn't code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate. This is a one-time setup process.
